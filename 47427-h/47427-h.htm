      he writer of these pages is not foolish enough to suppose that he can
      escape strong and bitter condemnation for his utterances. On this score he
      is not disposed to be greatly troubled; and for these reasons: Firstly&mdash;he
      feels that he is performing a <i>duty</i>; secondly&mdash;he is certain
      that his sentiments will be endorsed by hundreds upon whose opinion he
      sets great value; thirdly&mdash;he relieves his mind of a burden that has
      oppressed it for many years; and fourthly&mdash;as is evident upon the
      face of these pages&mdash;he is no professed <i>litterateur</i>, who can
      be starved by adverse criticism. Nevertheless he would be apostate to his
      self-appointed mission if he invited censure by unseemly defiance of those
      who must read and pass judgment upon his work. While, therefore, he does
      not desire to invoke the <i>leniency</i> of the professional critic or the
      casual reader, he does desire to justify the position he has taken as far
      as may be consistent with good taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will doubtless be asserted by many: That the writer is a "bigoted
      parson," whose puritanical and illiberal ideas concerning matters of which
      he has no personal experience belong to an age that is happily passed. On
      the contrary, he is a man of the world, who has mixed much in society both
      in the old world and the new, and who knows whereof he affirms.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he is, for some reason, unable to partake of the amusement he
      condemns, and is therefore jealous of those more fortunate than himself.
      Wrong again. He has drunk deeply of the cup he warns others to avoid; and
      has better opportunities than the generality of men to continue the
      draught if he found it to his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he publishes from motives of private malice. <i>Private</i> malice&mdash;no.
      Malice of a certain kind, yes. Malice against those who should know better
      than to abuse the rights of hospitality by making a bawdy-house of their
      host's dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the principal objection will doubtless refer to the plain language
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
      My excuse, if indeed excuse be needed for saying just what I mean, is,
      that it is impossible to clothe in delicate terms the intolerable
      nastiness which I expose, and at the same time to press the truth home to
      those who are most in need of it; I might as well talk to the winds as
      veil my ideas in sweet phrases when addressing people who it seems cannot
      descry the presence of corruption until it is held in all its putridity
      under their very nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, concerning the prudence and advisability of such a publication, I
      have only to say that I have consulted many leading divines and principals
      of educational institutions, all of whom agree that the subject must be
      dealt with plainly, and assure me that its importance demands more than
      ordinary treatment&mdash;that it is a foeman worthy of the sharpest steel;
      for, say they: To repeat the tame generalities uttered from the pulpit, or
      the quiet tone of disapprobation adopted by the press, would be to accord
      to the advocates of this evil a power which they do not possess, and to
      proclaim a weakness of its opponents which the facts will not justify.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have therefore spoken plainly and to the purpose, that those who run&mdash;or
      waltz&mdash;may read.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there remains yet something to be said, which is more necessary to my
      own peace of mind, and to that of many of my readers, than all that has
      gone before. So important is it, indeed, that what I am about to say
      should be distinctly understood by all those whose criticism I value, and
      whose feelings I respect, that I almost hesitate to consign it to that
      limbo of egotism&mdash;the preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be it known, then, that although in the following pages I have, without
      compunction, attacked the folly and vice of those who practice such, yet I
      would rather my right hand should wither than that the pen it wields
      should inflict a single wound upon one innocent person. I am willing to
      believe, nay, I <i>know</i>, that there are many men and women who can and
      do dance without an impure thought or action; for theirs is not the Dance
      of Death; they can take a reasonable pleasure in one another's society
      without wishing to be locked in one another's embrace; they can rest
      content with such graces as true refinement teaches them are modest,
      without leaping the bounds of decorum to indulge in what a false and fatal
      refinement styles the "poetry of motion;" in short, to them the waltz, in
      its newest phases at least, is a stranger. I would not, like Lycurgus and
      Mahomet, cut down all the vines, and forbid the drinking of wine, because
      it makes some men drunk. Dancers of this class, therefore, I implore not
      to regard the ensuing chapters as referring to themselves&mdash;the cap
      does not fit their heads, let them not attempt to wear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same remarks will apply to some of those heads of families who permit
      and encourage dancing at their homes. Many among them doubtless exercise a
      surveillance too strict to admit of anything improper taking place within
      their doors; these stand in no need of either advice or warning from me.
      But more of them, I am grieved to say, are merely blameless because they
      are ignorant of what really <i>does</i> take place. The social maelstrom
      whirls nightly in their drawing-rooms; with their wealth, hospitality; and
      countenance they unconsciously, but none the less surely, lure the fairest
      ships of life into its mad waters. Let these also, then, not be offended
      that in this book I raise a beacon over the dark vortex, within whose
      treacherous embrace so many sweet young souls have been whirled to
      perdition.

    <p>
      eader, I have an engagement to keep to-night. Let me take you with me; you
      will be interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, stay&mdash;I have a condition to make before I accept of your
      company. Have you read the preface? "No, of course not; who reads
      prefaces?" Very well, just oblige me by making mine an exception&mdash;it
      is a Gilead where you perhaps may obtain balm for the wounds you will
      receive on our expedition. And now, supposing you to have granted this
      request, let us proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our carriage pulls up before the entrance of an imposing mansion. From
      every window the golden gaslight streams out into the darkness; from the
      wide-open door a perfect glory floods the street from side to side. There
      is a hum of subdued voices within, there is a banging of coach doors
      without; there is revelry brewing, we may be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We step daintily from our carriage upon the rich carpet which preserves
      our patent-leathers from the contamination of the sidewalk; we trip
      lightly up the grand stone stairway to the entrance; obsequious lackeys
      relieve us of our superfluous raiment; folding doors fly open before us
      without so much as a "sesame" being uttered; and, behold, we enter upon a
      scene of enchantment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magnificent apartments succeed each other in a long vista, glittering with
      splendid decorations; costly frescoes are overhead, luxurious carpets are
      under foot, priceless pictures, rich laces, rare trifles of art are around
      us; an atmosphere of wealth, refinement, luxury, and good taste is
      all-pervading.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these are afterthoughts with us; it is the splendor of the assembled
      company that absorbs our admiration now. Let us draw aside and observe
      this throng a little, my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you have believed it possible that so much beauty and richness could
      have been collected under one roof? Score upon score of fair women and
      handsome men; the apparel of the former rich beyond conception&mdash;of
      the latter, immaculate to a fault. The rooms are pretty well filled
      already, but the cry is still they come.
    </p>
    <p>
      See yonder tall and radiant maiden, as she enters leaning upon the arm of
      her grey-headed father. Mark her well, my friend; I will draw your
      attention to her again presently. How proud of her the old man looks; and
      well he may. What divine grace of womanhood lives in that supple form;
      what calm, sweet beauty shines in that lovely face&mdash;a face so pure
      and passionless in expression that the nudity of bust and arms, and the
      contour of limbs more than suggested by the tightly clinging silk, call
      for no baser admiration than we feel when looking upon the representation
      of an angel. Observe closely with what high-bred and maidenly reserve she
      responds to the greeting of the Apollo in a "claw-hammer" who bows low
      before her&mdash;the very type of the elegant and polished gentleman. In
      bland and gentle tones he begs a favor to be granted a little later in the
      evening. With downcast eyes she smiles consent; with a bow he records the
      promise upon a tablet in his hand. Gracefully she moves forward again,
      leaning on her father's arm, smiling and nodding to her acquaintances, and
      repeating the harmless little ceremony described above with perhaps a
      dozen other Apollos before she reaches the end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, pure and lovely girl!" I hear you mutter as she disappears, "happy
      indeed is he who can win that jewel for a wife. That face will haunt me
      like a dream!" Likely enough, O my friend! but dreams are not all
      pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now look again at this young wife just entering with her husband. Is she
      not beautiful! and how devotedly she hangs upon his arm! With what a
      triumphant glance around the room he seems to say: "Behold my treasure&mdash;my
      very own; look at the gorgeousness of her attire, ladies, and pray for
      such a husband; gaze upon the fairness of her face, gentlemen, and covet
      such a wife." Again the Apollos step blandly forward, again the little
      promises are lisped out and recorded. And so the goodly company go on,
      introducing and being introduced, and conversing agreeably together. A
      right pleasant and edifying spectacle, surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, hark! The music strikes up; the dancing is about to begin. You and I
      do not dance; we withdraw to an adjoining room and take a hand at cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours go swiftly by and still we play on. The clock strikes two; the
      card-players are departing. But the strains of the distant music have been
      unceasing; the game does not flag in the ball-room. You have not seen a
      dance since your youth, you say, and then only the rude gambols of
      country-folk; you would fain see before you go how these dames and damsels
      of gentler breeding acquit themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dance is at its height; we could not have chosen a better time to see
      the thing in its glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approach the door of the ballroom the music grows louder and more
      ravishing than ever; no confusion of voices mars its delicious melody; the
      only sounds heard beneath its strains are a low swish and rustle as of
      whirling robes, and a light, but rapid and incessant shuffling of feet.
      The dull element has gone home; those who remain have better work to do
      than talking. We push the great doors asunder and enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ha! the air is hot and heavy here; it breathes upon us in sensuous gusts
      of varying perfumes. And no wonder. A score of whirling scented robes stir
      it into fragrance. How beautiful&mdash;but you look aghast, my friend. Ah,
      I forgot; these are not the rude countryfolk of your youth. You are
      dazzled&mdash;bewildered. Then let me try to enliven your dulled senses
      with a description of what we see.
    </p>
    <p>
      A score of forms whirl swiftly before us under the softened gaslight. I
      say a score of <i>forms</i>&mdash;but each is double&mdash;they would have
      made two score before the dancing began. Twenty floating visions&mdash;each
      male and female. Twenty women knit and growing to as many men, undulate,
      sway, and swirl giddily before us, keeping time with the delirious melody
      of piano, harp, and violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But draw nearer&mdash;let us see how this miracle is accomplished. Do you
      mark yonder tall couple who seem even to excel the rest in grace and
      ardor. Do they not make a picture which might put a soul under the ribs of
      Death? Such must have been the sight which made Speusippas incontinently
      rave: "O admirable, O divine Panareta! Who would not admire her, who would
      not love her, that should but see her dance as I did? O how she danced,
      how she tripped, how she turned! With what a grace! <i>Felix qui Panareta
      fruitur!</i> O most incomparable, only, Panareta!" Let Us take this couple
      for a sample. He is stalwart, agile, mighty; she is tall, supple, lithe,
      and how beautiful in form and feature! Her head rests upon his shoulder,
      her face is upturned to his; her naked arm is almost around his neck; her
      swelling breast heaves tumultuously against his; face to face they whirl,
      his limbs interwoven with her limbs; with strong right arm about her
      yielding waist, he presses her to him till every curve in the contour of
      her lovely body thrills with the amorous contact. Her eyes look into his,
      but she sees nothing; the soft music fills the room, but she hears
      nothing; swiftly he whirls her from the floor or bends her frail body to
      and fro in his embrace, but she knows it not; his hot breath is upon her
      hair, his lips almost touch her forehead, yet she does not shrink; his
      eyes, gleaming with a fierce intolerable lust, gloat satyrlike over her,
      yet she does not quail; she is filled with a rapture divine in its
      intensity&mdash;she is in the Maelstrom of burning desire&mdash;her spirit
      is with the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With a last, low wail the music ceases.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Her swooning; senses come back to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, must it be? Yes; her companion releases her from his embrace. Leaning
      wearily upon his arm, the rapture faded from her eye, the flush dying from
      her cheek&mdash;enervated, limp, listless, worn out&mdash;she is led to a
      seat, there to recover from her delirium and gather her energies as best
      she may in the space of five minutes, after which she must yield her body
      to a new embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did you not notice a faint smile upon the lips of her late companion
      as he turned and left her? a smile of triumph, an air of sated appetite,
      it seemed to me; and see, as he joins his cronies yonder he laughs, rubs
      his hands together, chuckles visibly, and communicates some choice scrap
      of news which makes them look over at our jaded beauty and laugh too; they
      appreciate the suggestion of the ancient:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      "Tenta modo tangere corpus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Jam tua mellifluo membra calore fluent."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But she can keep her secret better than they, it is evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now tell me, friend of mine, did you not recognize an old acquaintance
      in the lady we have been watching so closely? No! Then believe me she is
      no other than the "pure and lovely girl" you so much admired earlier in
      the evening, the so desirable wife, the angel who was to "haunt your
      dreams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!<i>that</i>harlot&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush&mdash;a spade is not called a spade here; but I assure you again that
      the sensuous, delirious Bacchante whose semi-nakedness was so apparent as
      she lay swooning in the arms of her param&mdash;partner just now, was one
      and the same with the chaste and calm Diana&mdash;<i>virgo virginissima</i>&mdash;whose
      modest mien concealed her nudity so well. Moreover the satyr who was her
      accomplice&mdash;I can find no better word&mdash;the coward who pastured
      upon her and then boasted of his lechery, was the Apollo who first saluted
      her; the little promise which she gave so gracefully, and which he
      recorded so eagerly, was a deliberate surrender of her body to his use and
      their mutual enjoyment. Furthermore, the old man who, filled with wine,
      sits asleep before the fire in the card-room, dreaming he holds thirteen
      trumps in his hand, is the proud father of our fair friend. Unselfish old
      man! he, like you, knows no dances but reels and minuets. "Why should not
      the dear girl enjoy herself?" he says; besides, if he grows tired he can
      go; Apollo will be glad to see her home. Apollo being rich, the old
      gentleman has no objection to see him chasing his Daphne; Cupio, Cupid,
      Cupidity&mdash;the Latin always knows what it is about.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, hark! The music begins again. <i>Le jeu est fait, faites votre jeu
      messieurs!</i> Gentlemen croupiers, prepare to rake in lost souls! All
      stakes are yours that come within your reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      With energies recuperated by stimulating refreshments, matron and maiden
      rise to the proffered embrace; with lusty vigor the Bulls of Bashan paw
      their fresh pastures. This is the last dance, and a furious one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Now round the room the circling dow'gers sweep,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now in loose waltz the thin-clad daughters leap;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The first in lengthened line majestic swim,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The last display the free, unfettered limb."

    <p>
      The Saturnalia will soon be ended. One more picture before we go.
    </p>
    <p>
      What right has that face over there to intrude amid this scene of wild
      festivity? That dark and scowling face, filled with hate, and jealousy,
      and stifled rage. See how its owner prowls restlessly about; continually
      changing his position, but ever keeping his watchful eyes upon that
      voluptuous woman who, surrendering her soul to the lascivious pleasing of
      opportunity, is reeling, gliding, and yielding in the clutch of her
      partner&mdash;her drunken catholicity of desire, her long libidinous
      reaches of imagination, the glib and facile assent of her emotions,
      figured in every movement, and visible to every eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the manner in which Bacchus and Ariadne danced, which so moved
      the spectators that, as the old writer tells us, "they that were unmarried
      swore they would forthwith marry, and those that were married called
      instantly for their horses and galloped home to their wives." That
      miserable, self-despised, desperate wretch is the exultant husband whom we
      noticed on his arrival; it is natural that he should take some interest in
      the lady,&mdash;she is the wife he was exulting over. No wonder that there
      is a dangerous look in his eye as he takes in the situation; the gallant
      who is dancing with his wife may sup with Polonius yet&mdash;late, or
      rather early, as it is, for "murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke."
      No wonder there is a hangdog expression in his face as his friends clap
      him on the back and applaud the lady's performance&mdash;ask him how he is
      enjoying the evening, and so forth. But the climax is reached when the
      sated Lothario restores the partner of <i>his</i> joys to her lawful lord,
      with the remark that "your wife, sir, dances most divinely;" then the poor
      fool must screw up a sickly smile and say "thank you, sir," knowing all
      the while in his heart of hearts that the man before him has just now most
      surely made him cuckold under his very nose. Poor fool! Will he <i>never</i>
      learn to appreciate the utter vileness of his situation? Will he <i>always</i>
      be persuaded next morning that he must have been excited by the champagne&mdash;that
      his jealousy was the acme of all unreason? Or will he, as many have done,
      pop out some fine day a full-fledged dancer himself, and compromise
      matters with his wife by making the degradation mutual?
    </p>
    <p>
      But while we ponder these things the melody has ceased; the weary
      musicians have departed. There is a rush for cloaks and hoods, and rather
      more adjusting of the same upon feminine forms by bold masculine hands
      than is perhaps necessary for their proper arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shift the scenery for the last act of this delectable drama!
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen will escort the ladies to their homes! Apollo will still
      pursue the nimble Daphne, Pan will not yet relinquish his hot pursuit of
      the fleetfooted Syrinx; and verily on this occasion their reward shall be
      greater than reeds and laurels. Forward, then, to the waiting carriages!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, how grateful to the gas-scorched eyeballs is the thick gloom of the
      coach&mdash;how pleasant to the weary limbs are these luxurious cushions!
    </p>
    <p>
      There! close the door softly; up with the windows&mdash;down with the
      curtains! Driver, go slowly, as I heard you ordered to do just now, and
      you shall not want for future patronage. And you, young man within, strike
      while the iron is hot. In your comrade every mental sense is stupified,
      every carnal sense is roused. It is the old, old story: "<i>Nox, vinum et
      adolescentia</i>." The opportunity is golden. Society is very good to you,
      young man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, my friend, let us go. The play is played out, and so are the
      players. The final tableau does not take place upon the stage. We read
      that under one of the Roman Emperors the pantomimic dance was not
      unfrequently ended by the putting to death by torture upon the stage of
      some condemned criminal, in order that the spectators might gaze upon
      death in all its horrible reality. God forbid that any such ghastly finale
      should take place <i>behind the scenes</i> now that <i>our</i> pantomime
      is finished! But at all events there is no more to see; and lest your
      imagination spoil your rest let me divert your attention to the speck of
      dawn over there in the east. At this hour, says the poet,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      "When late larks give warning
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Of dying lights and dawning,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Night murmurs to the morning,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      'Lie still, O love, lie still;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And half her dark limbs cover
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The white limbs of her lover,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With amourous plumes that hover
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      And fervent lips that chill."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But, mind you, in these lines the poet does not even remotely refer to the
      occupants of the carriage.

      <i>"The Dance is the spur of lust&mdash;a circle of which the Devil

      ut," says the worthy reader who has honored me by perusing the preceding
      Chapter, "what manner of disgusting revel is this that you have shown us?
      Have we been present at a reproduction of the rites of Dionysus and
      Astarte? Have we held high revel in the halls of a modern Faustina or
      Messalina? Have we supped with Catherine of Russia? Or have we been under
      the influence of a restored Lampsacene?
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't delude yourself, my unsophisticated friend, you have simply been
      present at a "social hop" at the house of the Hon. Ducat Fitzbullion&mdash;a
      most estimable and "solid" citizen, a deacon of the church, where his
      family regularly attend, a great promoter of charities, Magdalen Asylums,
      and the like, and President of the "Society for the Suppression of
      Immorality among the Hottentots." The fair women whom you have somewhat
      naturally mistaken for <i>prêtresses de la Vagabonde Vénus</i>, are the
      pure daughters and spotless wives of our "best citizens;" their male
      companions, or accomplices, or whatever you choose to call them, are the
      <i>creme de la creme</i> of all that is respectable and eligible in
      society; and, finally, the dance which you have pronounced outrageously
      indecent, is simply the Divine Waltz, in its various shapes of "Dip,"
      "Glide," "Saratoga," "German," and what not&mdash;the King of Dances "with
      all the modern improvements."
    </p>
    <p>
      And this, my dear reader, is the abomination that I intend to smite hip
      and thigh&mdash;not with fine words and dainty phrases, but with the
      homely language of truth; not blinded by prejudice or passion, but calmly
      and reasonably; not with any private purpose to subserve, but simply in
      the cause of common decency; not with the hope of working out any great
      moral reform, but having the the sense of <i>duty</i> strong upon me as I
      stick my nibbed lancet into the most hideous social ulcer that has yet
      afflicted the body corporate.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the subject is a delicate one is best shown by the fact that even
      Byron found himself reduced to the necessity of "Putting out the light"
      and invoking the longest garments to cover that which he was unable to
      describe&mdash;hear him:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Waltz&mdash;Waltz alone&mdash;both legs and arms demands;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Liberal of feet, and lavish of her hands;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Hands which may freely range in public sight
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Where ne'er before&mdash;but&mdash;pray "put out the light.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      * * * *
    </h3>
    <p class="indent15">
      "But here the muse with due decorum halts&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And lends her longest petticoats to Waltz"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It should not, then, be a matter of surprise, when one so gifted in the
      use of his mother tongue and writing in a far less prudish age, failed to
      describe the "voluptuous Waltz" without shocking his readers,&mdash;if I,
      sixty-three years later, with so much more to describe and such limited
      capacity, do not succeed in rendering the subject less repulsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many will urge that a practice indulged in by the "best people" of every
      country&mdash;seemingly tolerated by all&mdash;cannot be so violently
      assailed without some motive other than a disinterested desire to advocate
      a correct principle&mdash;but such are reminded that much more than
      one-half the male adult population of every American city are addicted to
      the use of tobacco. Is its baneful effect upon the nerves of man any the
      less severe on this account? So in the case of alcoholic beverages, is it
      open to debate that the great mass of our population are constantly
      consuming this "wet damnation"? And is it not known to all that it is the
      direct source of desolation to hearth and home, the destroyer of happiness
      and character,&mdash;that this has broken more hearts, filled more
      dishonored graves than any other of man's follies? Does, I say, the fact
      of its universality render its destroying influence less potent? I think
      not. Neither do I believe the fact of society permitting itself to be
      carried by storm into the toleration of the "modern" dance, obliterates
      the fearful vortex into which its members are drawn, or compensates for
      the irreparable loss it suffers in the degradation of its chief ornament&mdash;woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here is one great difficulty in my self-imposed task, for to lovely
      and pure woman must I partly address myself. Yet even a partial reference
      to the various considerations involved, entails the presenting of topics
      not generally admitted into refined conversation. But in order to do any
      justice at all to the subject, we must not only consider the dance itself,
      but we must follow it to its conclusion. We must look at its direct
      results. We must hold it responsible for the vice it encourages, the
      lasciviousness of which it so largely partakes. And in presenting this
      subject, I shall steadfastly ignore that line of argument based upon the
      assumption that because "it is general," it must be proper. Says
      Rochester:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Custom does often reason overrule,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And only serves for reason to the fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And Crabbe:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Habit with him was all the test of truth:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      It must be right&mdash;I've done it from my youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No, neither the use of tobacco, the indulgence in alcoholic beverages, nor
      the familiar posturing of the "Glide" can be justified or defended by
      proving that they are common to all classes of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeat that the scene I have attempted to describe in the foregoing
      chapter is no creation of a prurient imagination&mdash;would to God that
      it were&mdash;but is a scene that is enacted at every social entertainment
      which in these days is regarded by the class for whose benefit this work
      is written as worth the trouble of attending. I repeat that the female
      portion of the "class" referred to is not composed of what are commonly
      known as prostitutes, whatever the uninitiated spectator at their orgies
      may imagine, but of matrons who are held spotless, and of maidens who are
      counted pure&mdash;not only by the world in general, but by those
      husbands, fathers, and brothers, whose eyes should surely be the first to
      detect any taint upon the character of wife, daughter, or sister. And I
      repeat, moreover, that the social status of these people is not that of
      the rude peasant whose lewd pranks are the result of his ignorance, but
      that of the most highly cultivated and refined among us. These are the
      people who are expected to, and do, lead the world in all that is elegant
      and desirable; and the Waltz, forsooth, is one of their arts&mdash;one of
      the choice products of their ultra-civilization&mdash;brought to
      perfection by the grace with which God has gifted them above common folk,
      adorned by their wealth, and enjoyed by their high-strung sensibilities.
      The boor could not dance as they do though he were willing to give his
      immortal soul to possess the accomplishment, for the waltz, in its
      perfection, is a pleasure reserved for the social pantheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said one to me, stooping forward in the most confidential way "Do you see
      that young lady to the left? How exquisitely the closely drawn silk
      discloses her wasp-like form! and those motions&mdash;could anything be
      more suggestive? Every movement of her body is a perfect reproduction of
      Hogarth's line of beauty. Look man! Remove just a little drapery and there
      is nothing left to desire&mdash;is'nt it wonderful? But then," added he,
      "it is a perfect outrage nevertheless."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so, I answered. Can aught be said against her reputation? no!&mdash;a
      thousand times no&mdash;and as for her dress, is it not the perfection of
      what all others in the room are but a crude attempt to accomplish? Does it
      not disclose a form intrinsically beautiful, and admit of a grace and
      "poetry of motion" quite unknown to those encumbered with petticoats? Yes,
      look at her backward and forward movements&mdash;see how she entwines her
      lithe limbs with those of her enraptured partner as they oscillate,
      advance, recede, and rotate, as though they were "spitted on the same
      bodkin."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Thus front to front the partners move or stand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The foot may rest, but none withdraw the hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This, sir, is but one of the many <i>improvements</i> on the waltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      And pray, sir, are not this lady to the right and that one in the center,
      vainly endeavoring to achieve the same feat? The only difference is that
      this lady is better dressed, more ably taught than either; is she to be
      censured because she has the talent and industry to do well, that which
      they have neither the courage, energy, nor ability to perform?

      lready I see the face of the reader grow red with indignation. "This is a
      calumniator, an infamous detractor, an envious pessimist, a hater of all
      that is innocently enjoyable!" cries he or she. Very well&mdash;I bow my
      acknowledgements for the compliment. I have already stated in my preface
      that I did not expect you to say anything else. I could be well content to
      tell what I know and let you say your say in peace, but I will
      nevertheless go somewhat out of my way to answer your principal
      objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, there are certainly many who will deny my charges <i>in
      toto</i>&mdash;who will declare that the waltz is very moral and
      healthful, and entirely innocent and harmless, and that he who puts it in
      any other light is a knave and a vile slanderer. These of my opponents I
      may divide into two classes: First, those who know nothing of the matter,
      who have never danced, have scarcely ever seen a modern waltz, and are
      consequently unwilling to believe that such terrible things could be going
      on in their very midst without their knowledge; and, secondly, those who
      do know and practice the abomination, and find "the fruit of the tree of
      knowledge" far too sweet to be hedged about as "forbidden."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the first of these classes I have little to say; it is composed mainly
      of "old fogies," the diversions of whose youth were innocent, and who can
      see no evil that does not sprawl in all its ugliness over the face of the
      community. If a courtesan accosted one of them on the street, they would
      be unutterably shocked, and so they certainly would if they on a sudden
      found themselves experiencing the "perfect waltz," though even then it is
      doubtful if they would not be shocked into dumbness and grieved into
      inaction. But of the veiled and subtle pleasures of the waltz they are
      profoundly ignorant&mdash;why should they not be? They see no harm in it
      because they don't see it at all; they are optimists through ignorance,
      and lift palms of deprecation at the mention of vice which they cannot
      understand or attain to. To these I say: open your eyes and look about
      you, even at the risk of seeing things not exactly as you fancied them to
      be; or, if you <i>will</i> remain obstinately blind, then pray do not deny
      that evil exists where you do not happen to see it with your eyes shut. I
      have painted the picture, you can compare it with the reality at your
      leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the second class that I have mentioned, namely, those who know and deny
      what they know, a far stronger condemnation is to be applied. It is
      composed of the dancers * <i>par excellence</i>, both male and female&mdash;who
      have tasted of the unholy pleasures of the waltz until it has become the
      very sap of their lives. These are the blushing rakes and ogling prudes
      who will be most bitter in their denunciation of this book and its author;
      and no wonder&mdash;I only oppose the prejudices of the others, but I
      contend with the passions of these. These it is who are forever prating of
      the beauties and virtues of the waltz. It is an "innocent recreation," a
      "healthful exercise," it is the "mother of grace" and the "poetry of
      motion;" no eulogy can be too extravagant for them to bestow upon their
      idol. <i>They</i> see no harm in it, not they, and for those who dare hint
      at such a thing, they have ever ready at their tongue's end that most
      convenient and abused of legends: <i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>. They
      will catch at any straw to defend their pet amusement. They will tell you
      that The Preacher says "there is a time to dance," without stopping to
      inquire why that ancient cynic put the words "there is a time to mourn" in
      such close proximity. They will inform you that Plato, in his
      Commonwealth, will have dancing-schools to be maintained, "that young
      folks may meet, be acquainted, see one another, and be seen," but they
      forget to mention that he will also have them dance naked, or to quote the
      comments of Eusebius and Theodoret upon Plato's plan. They think the
      secret of their great respect for the waltz is possessed only by
      themselves, and hug the belief that by them that secret shall never be
      divulged. Bah! They must dance with the gas out if there is to be any
      secrecy in the matter.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I have stated several times, and I now do so for the last
     time, that by "dancers" I mean waltzers. I hope that my
     meaning will not be wilfully misconstrued.
</pre>
    <p>
      Innocent and healthful recreation forsooth! The grotesque abominations of
      the old Phallic worship had a basis of clean and wholesome truth, but as
      the obscene rites of that worship desecrated the principle that inspired
      them, so do the pranks of the "divine waltz" libel the impulse that stirs
      its wriggling devotees. The fire that riots in their veins and the motive
      that actuates their haunches is an honest flame and a decent energy when
      honestly and decently invoked, but if blood and muscle would be pleased to
      indulge their impotent raptures in private, the warmer virtues would not
      be subjected to open caricature, nor the colder to downright outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do I mean by such insinuations? Nay, then, gentle reader, I will not
      insinuate, but will boldly state that with the class with which I am now
      dealing&mdash;the dancers par excellence, the modern waltz is not merely
      "suggestive," as its opponents have hitherto charitably styled it, but an
      open and shameless gratification of sexual desire and a cooler of burning
      lust. To lookers-on it is "suggestive" enough, Heaven knows, but to the
      dancers&mdash;that is to say, to the "perfect dancers"&mdash;it is an
      actual realization of a certain physical ecstacy which should at least be
      indulged in private, and, as some would go so far as to say, under
      matrimonial restrictions. And this is the secret to which I have alluded.
      It cannot even be <i>claimed</i> as private property any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For shame!" cries the horrified (and non-waltzing) reader; "how can you
      make such dreadfully false assertions! And who are these 'perfect dancers'
      you talk so much about? And how came <i>you</i> to know their 'secret' as
      you term it? Surely no woman of even nominal decency would make such a
      horrible confession, and yet the most immaculate women waltz, and waltz
      divinely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      By your leave, I will answer these questions one at a time. Who are these
      "perfect waltzers?" Of the male sex there are several types, of which I
      need only mention two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is your lively and handsome young man&mdash;a Hercules in brawn
      and muscle&mdash;who exults in his strength and glories in his manhood.
      Dancing comes naturally to him, as does everything else that requires
      grace and skill. He is a ruthless hunter to whom all game is fair. The
      gods have made him beautiful and strong, and the other sex recognize and
      appreciate the fact. Is it to be expected of Alcibiades that he scorn the
      Athenian lasses, or of Phaon the Fair that he avoid the damsels of
      Mytelene? No indeed! it is for the husband and father to take care of the
      women&mdash;<i>he</i> can take care of himself. Yet even this gay social
      pirate and his like might take a hint from the poet:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "But ye&mdash;who never felt a single thought
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For what our morals are to be, or ought;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who wisely wish the charms you view to reap,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Say&mdash;would you make those beauties quite so cheap?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But this fine animal is by no means the most common or degraded type of
      ball-room humanity. It would be perhaps better if he were. In his mighty
      embrace a woman would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that she
      was dancing with a wholesome creature, however destitute he might be of
      the finer feelings that go to make up what is called a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, the most common type of the male "perfect dancer" is of a different
      stamp. This is the blockhead who covers his brains with his boots&mdash;to
      whom dancing is the one serious practical employment of life, and who, it
      must be confessed, is most diligent and painstaking in his profession. He
      is chastity's paramour&mdash;strong and lusty in the presence of the
      unattainable, feeble-kneed and trembling in the glance of invitation; in
      pursuit a god, in possession an incapable&mdash;satyr of dalliance, eunuch
      of opportunity. This creature dances divinely. He has given his mind to
      dancing, has never got it back, and is the richer for that. He haunts
      "hops" and balls because his ailing virility finds a feast in the paps and
      gruels of love there dispensed. It is he to whose contaminating embrace
      your wi&mdash;I mean your neighbor's wife or daughter, dear reader, is
      oftenest surrendered, to whet his dulled appetite for strong meats of the
      bagnio&mdash;nay to coach him for offences that <i>must</i> be nameless
      here. She performs her function thoroughly, conscientiously, wholly&mdash;merges
      her identity in his, and lo! the Beast with two Backs!
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty picture is it not?&mdash;-the Grand Passion Preservative dragged
      into the blaze of gas to suffer pious indignities at the hand of
      worshippers who worship not wisely, but too well! The true Phallos set up
      at a cross-roads to receive the homage of strolling dogs&mdash;male and
      female created he them! Bah! these orgies are the spawn of unmannerly
      morals. They profane our civilization, and are an indecent assault upon
      common sense. It is nearly as common as the dance itself, to hear the male
      participants give free expression, loose tongued, to the lewd emotions,
      the sensual pleasure, in which they indulge when locked in the embrace of
      your wives and daughters; if this be true, if by any possibility it can be
      true, that a lady however innocent in thought is exposed to lecherous
      comments of this description, then is it not also true that <i>every</i>
      woman possessing a remnant of delicacy, will flee from the dancing-hall as
      from a pestilence.

      et us now consider the female element in this immodesty. Is the woman
      equally to blame with the man? Is she the unconscious instrument of his
      lust, or the conscious sharer in it? We shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, it is absolutely necessary that she shall be able and
      willing to reciprocate the feelings of her partner before she can graduate
      as a "divine dancer." Until she can and will do this she is regarded as a
      "scrub" by the male experts, and no matter what her own opinion of her
      proficiency may be she will surely not be sought as a companion in that <i>piece
      de résistance</i> of the ball-room the "after&mdash;supper glide."
    </p>
    <p>
      Horrible as this statement seems, it is the truth and nothing but the
      truth, and though I could affirm it upon oath from what I have myself
      heard and seen, I fortunately am able to confirm it by the words of a
      highly respected minister of the gospel&mdash;Mr. W. C. Wilkinson, who
      some years ago published in book form an article on "The Dance of Modern
      Society," which originally appeared in one of our American Quarterly
      Reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman gives a remark overheard on a railway car, in a
      conversation that was passing between two young men about their lady
      acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The horrible concreteness of the fellow's expression," says Mr.
      Wilkinson, "may give a wholesome recoil from danger to some minds that
      would be little affected by a speculative statement of the same idea. Said
      one: I would not give a straw to dance with Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;;
      you can't excite any more passion in her than you can in a stick of wood."
      Can anything be plainer than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pure young women of a warmer temperament," the same reverend author
      subsequently adds, "who innocently abandon themselves to enthusiastic
      proclamations of their delight in the dance in the presence of gentlemen,
      should but barely once have a male intuition of the <i>meaning</i> of the
      involuntary glance that will often shoot across from eye to eye among
      their auditors. Or should overhear the comments exchanged among them
      afterwards. For when young men meet after an evening of the dance to talk
      it over together, it is not points of dress they discuss. Their only
      demand (in this particular) and it is generally conceded, is that the
      ladies' dress and shall not needlessly embarrass suggestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      But here is one of my own experiences in this connection. At a fashionable
      sociable, I was approached by a friend who had been excelling himself in
      Terpsichorean feats during the whole evening. This friend was a very
      handsome man, a magnificent dancer, and of course a great favorite with
      the ladies. I had been watching him while he waltzed with a young and
      beautiful lady, also of my acquaintance, and had been filled with wonder
      at the way he had folded her in his arms&mdash;literally fondling her upon
      his breast, and blending her delicate melting form into his ample embrace
      in a manner that was marvellous to behold. They had whirled and writhed in
      a corner for fully ten minutes&mdash;the fury of lust in his eyes, the
      languor of lust in hers&mdash;until gradually she seemed to lose her
      senses entirely, and must have slipped down upon the floor when he finally
      released her from his embrace had it not been for the support of his arm
      and shoulder. Now as he came up to me all flushed and triumphant I
      remarked to him that he evidently enjoyed this thing very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do," he answered. "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I should think," said I, not wishing to let him see that I knew
      anything about the matter from experience, "that your passions would
      become unduly excited by such extremely close contact with the other sex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excited!" he replied, "of course they do; but not unduly&mdash;what else
      do you suppose I come here for? And don't you know, old fellow," he added
      in a burst of confidence, "that this waltzing is the grandest thing in the
      world. While you are whirling one of those charmers&mdash;if you do it
      properly, mind you&mdash;you can whisper in her ear things which she would
      not listen to at any other time. Ah! but she likes it then, and comes
      closer still, and in response to the pressure of her hand, your arm
      tightens about her waist, and then"&mdash;but here he grew very eloquent
      at the bare remembrance, and the morals of the printer must be respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said I, "I should be afraid to take such liberties with a
      respectable woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O," he answered, "that's nothing&mdash;they like it; but, as I said
      before, you must know how to do it; there must be no blundering; they wont
      stand that. The best place to learn to do the thing correctly is in one of
      those dance-cellars; there you can take right hold of them. The girls
      there are "posted," you know; and they'll soon "post" you. Let everything
      go loose. You will soon fall into the step. All else comes natural. I go
      round amongst them all. Come with me a few nights, I'll soon make a
      waltzer of you&mdash;you will see what there is in it." He still rests
      under the promise to "show me round" in the interests of the diffusion of
      useful knowledge; and if he does not trace the authorship of this book to
      me, and take offence thereat, I will go at some future time. It must
      indeed be "jolly," as he called it, to possess such consumate skill in an
      art which makes the wives and daughters of our "best people" the willing
      instruments of his lechery. Oh yes&mdash;I <i>must learn</i>. This is a
      supreme accomplishment I cannot afford to be without. It has been said
      that out of evil comes good, and assuredly "this is an evil born with all
      its teeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes," continued my enthusiastic friend, "it isn't the whirling that
      makes the waltz, and those who think it is are the poorest dancers. A
      little judicious handling will make a sylph out of the veriest gawk of a
      girl that ever attempted the "light' fantastic;" and once manage to
      initiate one of those stay-at-home young ladies, and I'll warrant you
      she'll be on hand at every ball she is invited to for the rest of that
      season. I'll wager, sir, that there isn't a "scrub" in this room who just
      knows the step but what I can make a dancer of her in fifteen minutes&mdash;the
      dear creatures take to it naturally when they are properly taught. But
      don't forget to come with me to the 'dives' one of these evenings and I'll
      show you what there is in it." And this was the estimation in which this
      man held the ladies of his acquaintance: this is the kind of satyr to the
      quenching of whose filthy lusts we are to furnish our wives and daughters;
      this is the manner of Minotaur who must be fed upon comely virgins&mdash;may
      he recognize a Theseus in these pages!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, dear reader, do not imagine that this man was a social ogre of
      unusual monstrosity. No, indeed, he was, and is, a "very nice young man;"
      he is, in fact, commonly regarded as a model young man. Nor must you
      imagine that his partner had a single stain upon her reputation. She is a
      young lady of the highest respectability; she takes a great interest in
      Sunday schools, is regular at the communion-table, makes flannel
      waistcoats for the heathen, and is on all sides allowed to be the greatest
      catch of the season in the matrimonial market. If she and the young man in
      question meet in the street, a modest bow on her part, and a respectful
      lifting of the hat on his, are the only greetings interchanged&mdash;he
      may enjoy her body in the ball-room, but, you see, he is not well enough
      acquainted with her to take her hand on the street.

      he conversation I have given in the last chapter is faithfully reported&mdash;it
      is exact in spirit very nearly so in letter; we may surely believe that
      the clergyman from whom I have quoted some pages back, was honest in his
      statements, and I think that there can be no man who has mixed among his
      sex in the ballroom and not heard similar remarks made. All this is, it
      seems to me, ample proof of the fact which I set out to demonstrate,
      namely, that the lechery of the waltz is not confined to the males, but is
      consciously participated in by the females, and if further evidence be
      needed, then, I say, take the best of all&mdash;watch the dancers at their
      sport&mdash;mark well the faces, the contortions of body and limb, and be
      convinced against your will. But even over and beyond this, I shall now
      lay before you a kind of testimony which you will be surprised to find
      brought to bear on the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after I had determined to publish a protest against the
      abominations of the waltz, it became plainly apparent to me that I must if
      possible obtain the views on the subject of some intelligent and well
      known lady, whose opinion would be received with respect by all the world.
      With this end in view, I addressed one of the most eminent and renowned
      women of America. I could not fortell the result of such a step, I
      certainly did not expect it to be what it is, I hardly dared to hope that
      she would accede to my request in any shape. But I knew that if she did
      speak, it would be according to her honest convictions, and I resolved in
      that event to publish her statement whatever it might be. This lady freely
      and generously offered me the use of her name, and as this would be of
      great value to my undertaking, I had originally intended to print it; but
      upon consideration I have concluded that it would be a poor return for her
      kindness and self-devotion, to subject her to the fiery ordeal of
      criticism she would in that case have to endure, and for this reason, and
      this only, I withhold her name for the present. But I do earnestly assure
      the reader that if ever the words of a great and good woman deserved
      respectful attention, it is these:&mdash;"You ask me to say what I think
      about 'round dances.' I am glad of the opportunity to lay my opinion on
      that subject before the world; though, indeed I scarcely know what I can
      write which you have not probably already written. I will, however,
      venture to lay bare a young girl's heart and mind by giving you my own
      experience in the days when I waltzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In those times I cared little for Polka or Varsovienne, and still less
      for the old-fashioned 'Money Musk' or 'Virginia Reel,' and wondered what
      people could find to admire in those 'slow dances.' But in the soft
      floating of the waltz I found a strange pleasure, rather difficult to
      intelligibly describe. The mere anticipation fluttered my pulse, and when
      my partner approached to claim my promised hand for the dance I felt my
      cheeks glow a little sometimes, and I could not look him in the eyes with
      the same frank gaiety as heretofore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the climax of my confusion was reached when, folded in his warm
      embrace, and giddy with the whirl, a strange, sweet thrill would shake me
      from head to foot, leaving me weak and almost powerless and really almost
      obliged to depend for support upon the arm which encircled me. If my
      partner failed from ignorance, lack of skill, or innocence, to arouse
      these, to me, most pleasurable sensations, I did not dance with him the
      second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am speaking openly and frankly, and when I say that I did not
      understand what I felt, or what were the real and greatest pleasures I
      derived from this so-called dancing, I expect to be believed. But if my
      cheeks grew red with uncomprehended pleasure then, they grow pale with
      shame to-day when I think of it all. It was the physical emotions
      engendered by the magnetic contact of strong men that I was enamoured of&mdash;not
      of the dance, nor even of the men themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus I became abnormally developed in my lowest nature. I grew bolder,
      and from being able to return shy glances at first, was soon able to meet
      more daring ones, until the waltz became to me and whomsoever danced with
      me, one lingering, sweet, and purely sensual pleasure, where heart beat
      against heart, hand was held in hand, and eyes looked burning words which
      lips dared not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this while no one said to me: you do wrong; so I dreamed of sweet
      words whispered during the dance, and often felt while alone a thrill of
      joy indescribable yet overpowering when my mind would turn from my studies
      to remember a piece of temerity of unusual grandeur on the part of one or
      another of my cavaliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girls talk to each other. I was still a school girl although mixing so
      much with the world. We talked together. We read romances that fed our
      romantic passions on seasoned food, and none but ourselves knew what
      subjects we discussed. Had our parents heard us they would have considered
      us on the high road to ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet we had been taught that it was right to dance; our parents did it,
      our friends did, and we were permitted. I will say also that all the girls
      with whom I associated, with the exception of one, had much the same
      experience in dancing; felt the same strangely sweet emotions, and felt
      that almost imperative necessity for a closer communion than that which
      even the freedom of a waltz permits, without knowing exactly why, or even
      comprehending what.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married now, with home and children around me, I can at least thank God
      for the experience which will assuredly be the means of preventing my
      little daughters from indulging in any such dangerous pleasure. But, if a
      young girl, pure and innocent in the beginning, can be brought to feel
      what I have confessed to have felt, what must be the experience of a
      married woman? <i>She</i> knows what every glance of the eye, every bend
      of the head, every close clasp means, and knowing that reciprocates it and
      is led by swifter steps and a surer path down the dangerous, dishonorable
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt if my experience will be of much service, but it is the candid
      truth, from a woman who, in the cause of all the young girls who may be
      contaminated, desires to show just to what extent a young mind may be
      defiled by the injurious effects of round dances. I have not hesitated to
      lay bare what are a young girl's most secret thoughts, in the hope that
      people will stop and consider, at least before handing their lillies of
      purity over to the arms of any one who may choose to blow the frosty
      breath of dishonor on their petals."
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is the experience of a woman of unusual strength of character&mdash;one
      whose intellect has gained her a worldwide celebrity and earned for her
      the respect and attention of multitudes wherever the English language is
      spoken. What hope is there then for ordinary women to escape from this
      mental and physical contamination? which

      any will say&mdash;have said&mdash;Byron wrote against the waltz because a
      physical infirmity prevented him from waltzing&mdash;that he is not a
      proper person to quote as an example for others to follow. It must be
      conceded that whatever his motive was, he <i>well knew</i> what he was
      writing about, and whatever his practices may have been in other respects,
      it is to his credit that his sense of the proprieties of life were not so
      blunted as to render him blind to this cause of gross public
      licentiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, unlike Byron, I have, as has been stated before, <i>practical
      experience, and positive knowledge</i> in the matter whereof I speak, and
      am possessed of the most convincing assurances that my utterances will be
      received with joy by thousands of husbands and fathers whose views have
      been down-trodden&mdash;their sentiments disregarded, and their notions of
      morality held up to scorn because they disapprove of this "innocent
      amusement."
    </p>
    <p>
      It has also been before said that this vice was "seemingly tolerated by
      all," but I am proud to say that the placard posted about the streets
      announcing a

      does not reflect the sentiments of the entire community; that in all the
      marts of business, in every avenue of trade, in counting-house and in
      work-shop, men are to be found who would shrink with horror from exposing
      their wives and daughters to the allurements of the dance-hall&mdash;men
      who form a striking contrast to those simpering simpletons who sympathize
      with their feelings, but have not the courage to maintain the family honor
      by enforcing their views in the domestic circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only a few years since the <i>Frankfort Journal</i> announced that
      the authorities had decided, in the interest of good morals, that in
      future dancing-masters should not teach their art to children who had not
      yet been confirmed. The teaching of dancing in boarding-houses and hotels
      was also forbidden. It is not desirable that the law should interfere with
      purely domestic affairs, but really it seems as if those unfortunate
      parents and husbands who shudder at the evil but are awed into silence by
      ridicule or open rebellion, stand in as urgent need of the law's
      assistance as the Magdeburg godfathers and godmothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I well know that many young ladies profess entire innocence of any impure
      emotions during all this "palming work."
    </p>
    <p>
      To them let me say: If you are so sluggish in your sensibilities as this
      would imply, then you are not fit subjects for the endearments of married
      life, and can give but poor promise of securing your husband's affection.
      But if on the other hand (as in most cases is true) you experience the
      true bliss of this intoxication, then indeed will the ground of your
      emotions be pretty well worked over before you reach the hymeneal altar,
      and the nuptial couch will have but little to offer for your consideration
      with which you are not already familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend at my elbow remarks. "I agree with you perfectly, but my wife
      likes these dances,&mdash;sees no harm in them, and her concluding and
      unanswerable argument is, that if I danced them, I should like them just
      as well as she does." The truth of this latter statement depends upon your
      moral perceptions. There is but one answer to the former, given by
      "Othello,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "This is the curse of Marriage:

    <p class="indent15">
      We call these delicate creatures ours&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But not their appetites."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are so lax in your attention&mdash;so deficient in those qualities
      which go to make a woman happy&mdash;that she seeks the embrace of other
      men to supply the more than half acknowledged need&mdash;if this be true,
      my friend, I leave the matter with you&mdash;it belongs to another class
      of subjects, treated of by Doctor Acton of London&mdash;-I refer you to
      his able works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another says: Both my wife and I enjoy these dances. We see no particular
      harm in them&mdash;"to the pure all things are pure." The very same thing
      may be said by the <i>habitués</i> of other haunts of infamy&mdash;

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      ''Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, again, a very large class of dancers who frankly allow that
      there is immorality in the modern waltz, but insist that this immorality
      need not be, and by them is not, practised. They dance&mdash;but very
      properly, you know. These are the Pharisees who beat their breasts in
      public places, crying fie! upon their neighbors, and bravo! upon
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, they will tell you, there are persons who are excited impurely
      by the waltz, but these are persons who would be immoral under any
      circumstances. "To the pure all things are pure." It is astonishing how
      apt they are with these tongue-worn aphorisms. To the pure all things are
      pure,&mdash;yes, but purity is only a relative virtue whose value is fixed
      by the moral standard of the individual. What would be pure to some would
      be grossly impure to others, and when you place your wife or daughter in
      the arms of such salacious gentry as have been described in the foregoing
      pages are you not pretty much in the position of the gentleman who when
      gravely informed by a guest who was taking an unaccountably hasty leave
      that his (the host's) wife had lewdly entreated him, replied: "But, my
      friend, that is nothing; your wife did as much for me when I visited you
      last year." This gentleman, remember, was also ready to add: "to the pure
      all things are pure." The Waltz should assuredly have figured among the
      "pure impurities" of Petronius.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even if it <i>be</i> allowed that a lady can waltz virtuously, I have
      already shown that in that case she must not dance <i>well</i>. And what a
      pitiful spectacle, surely, is that of a lady trying "how not to do it"&mdash;converting
      her natural grace into clumsiness in order that she may do an indecent
      thing decently, and remain
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Warm but not wanton; dazzled, but not blind."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps she <i>cannot</i> waltz. In that case how long will it take
      her to learn? Will not one single dance lower her standard of purity if
      her partner happens to be one of the adepts I have described?
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," cries the fair dancer "you must remember that no lady will permit
      herself to be introduced to, or accept as a partner, any but a gentleman,
      who she is sure will treat her with becoming respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not stop to inquire what her definition of a "gentleman" is&mdash;-whether
      the most courteous and urbane of men may not be a most desperate roué at
      heart. The attitude and contact are the same in any case, and if it needs
      must be that a husband is to see his wife folded in the close embrace of
      another man, is it any consolation for him to know that her partner is
      eligible as a rival in other respects than his nimble feet&mdash;that he
      who is brushing the bloom from his peach is at least his equal? Can you
      stop to consider the intellectual accomplishments and social status of the
      man who has invaded the sacred domain of your wife's chamber? No&mdash;equally
      unimportant is it to you, who or what he may be&mdash;that has thus
      exercised a privilege reserved by all pure-minded women for their husbands
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this matter of the selection of the fittest the ladies have set up
      a man of straw, which I must proceed to demolish. In order that the
      lawless contact may be impartially distributed, and that no lady may be
      free to choose whose sexual magnetism she shall absorb, we have imported
      from across the water a foreign variety of the abomination, by which
      ingenious contrivance the color of the ribbon a lady chances to hold
      determines who shall have the use of her body in the waltz, and places her
      in the pitiable predicament of the "poore bryde" at ancient French
      weddings, who, as we read in Christen, "State of Matrimony," must "kepe
      foote with all dancers, and refuse none, how scabbed, foule, droncken,
      rude, and shameless soever he be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor are even the square dances any longer left as a refuge for the more
      modest, for to such a pitch has the passion for this public sexual
      intimacy come, that the waltz is now inseparably wedded to the quadrille.
      Even the old fogies are sometimes trapped by this device. A quadrille is
      called and they take their places feeling quite safe. "First couple
      forward!" "Cross over!" "Change partners!" "Waltz up and down the centre!"
      "Change over!" "All hands waltz round the outside!" and before they know
      it their sedate notions are lost in the "waltz quadrille." It may be said
      that every arrangement of the dance looks to an "equitable" distribution
      of each lady's favors. It is a recognized fact that a lady dancing
      repeatedly with the same gentleman shows a marked preference thereby&mdash;and
      he is deemed rude and selfish who attempts to monoplize his affianced, or
      shows reluctance in resigning her to the arms of another.

      one time ago a lady friend said to me: "How is it that while so many of
      you gentlemen are fond of dancing until you are married, yet from that
      moment few of you can be induced to dance any more. In fact it is a fraud
      perpetrated upon young ladies; you fall in love with them in the ball
      room, you court them there, you marry them there, and they naturally think
      you will continue to take them there. But no&mdash;thenceforth they must
      stay at home, or if you induced to go occasionally, you are as cross and
      ill-natured about it as possible; as though it was something dreadful. If
      the dancing-hall is good enough to get a wife in, is it not good enough to
      take a wife to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear lady, said I, you have stated the case with a fairness not often
      met with in an opponent. There can be no stronger evidence (none other is
      required) to establish the sexualism of the popular dance than that which
      you have just cited. The privileges of matrimony relieve the necessity for
      the dance. The <i>lover</i> is compelled to share that which the <i>husband</i>
      considers all his own. Those who, while single, were most deeply versed in
      the mysteries and pleasures of the waltz are, when married, the first to
      proclaim their abhorrence of it, too often, it is true, in a mild and
      impotent protest, but not always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the reader acquainted with Boyesen's novel called "Gunnar?" If so he
      will remember that Ragnhild was to wed Lars under the pressure of parental
      authority. She preferred, however, the valiant, dancing Gunnar. "Ha! ha!
      ha!" cried he, "strike up a tune and that a right lusty one!" The music
      struck up, he swung upon his heel, caught the girl who stood nearest him
      round the waist; and whirled away with her. Suddenly he stopped and gazed
      right into her face, and who should it be but Ragnhild. She begged and
      tried to release herself from his arm, but he lifted her from the floor,
      made another leap, and danced away, so that the floor shook under them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gunnar, Gunnar," whispered she, "please, Gunnar, let me go"&mdash;he
      heard nothing. "Gunnar," begged she again, now already half surrendering,
      "only think what mother would say if she were here." But now she began to
      feel the spell of the dance. The walls, the roof, and the people began to
      whirl round her in a strange, bewildering circle; at one moment the music
      seemed to be winging its way to her from an unfathomable depth in an
      inconceivable, measureless distance, and in the next it was roaring and
      booming in her ears with the rush and din of an infinite cataract of tone.
      Unconsciously her feet moved to its measure, her heart beat to it, <i>and
      she forgot her scruples</i>, her fear, and everything but <i>him</i> in
      the bliss of the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gunnar knew how to tread the springing dance, and no one would deny him
      the rank of the first dancer in the valley, so, it was a dance worth
      seeing, and of the girls, there was scarcely one who did not wish herself
      in the happy Ragnhild's place"&mdash;(of course they did.) After the music
      had ceased, it was some time before Ragnhild fully recovered her senses&mdash;(quite
      likely); she still clung fast to Gunnar's arm, the floor seemed to be
      heaving and sinking under her&mdash;(quite common in such cases), and the
      space was filled with a vague, distant hum." (Why not?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, the gleaming knife in the hands of Lars, showed that he but too
      plainly understood the nature of the performance in which his future wife
      had been engaged. And the sequel well attests, that his happiness did not
      increase with his knowledge. Even the vigor of a Norwegian climate was not
      sufficient to cool his fury. What a promising field for future operations
      must sunnier climes present for such enterprising young gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Follow the subject a little further and it will be seen that Ragnhild lost
      more than her head in the bewildering whirl. Now let me ask any father or
      mother (or husband if you will),&mdash;any man possessing a grain of
      common sense, if Ragnhild was in a safe condition to be shown by Gunnar,
      to one of our commodious carriages and driven to her home (perhaps miles
      away) at three o'clock in the morning?

      There are two types of married ladies who practise, and of course enjoy,
      the waltz, and lest either might discover the portrait of the other and
      take offence that her own lovely face was not used to adorn these pages,
      each shall have a separate notice. They will probably have already
      recognized portraits of themselves in this volume, but the object here is
      more particularly to distinguish between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these we may safely call semi-respectable&mdash;she is so
      partly from necessity, partly from choice&mdash;from choice because she
      regards it as the "proper thing" that her husband should dance attendance
      while she dances something else, during the performance of which, the poet
      tells us,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "The fair one's breast
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gives all it can and bids us take the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She has not yet quite reached that stage of shamelessness when she can
      carouse the entire night without some lingering regard for what Mrs.
      Grundy will say; besides this, she is not quite sure of her position, and
      does not know exactly how much her husband will bear. She is afflicted
      with a bare suspicion that his docile nature might be over taxed&mdash;that
      in the pigeon holes of his dull cranium might be found a desire to make it
      rather lively if too openly slighted. "Oh, no," she reasons, "take him
      along&mdash;his presence makes it all right&mdash;his smile gives sanction
      to all that may happen. When he is with me who dare complain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the woman whom it would be my joy to describe, whose perfections
      surpass description, is moved by no such paltry considerations. She
      glories in an independence which scorns all such petty restraints. She it
      is whose insight into domestic politics descries the true position, "to go
      with her husband is a bore"&mdash;his very presence is a hindrance to a
      full and free exercise of all the privileges of the "Boston Dip." She can
      find it in her heart <i>now</i> to laugh at the ridiculous vow she made
      when playing that old-fashioned farce before the altar&mdash;the vow to
      "leave all others and cleave to him alone." How much pleasanter, surely,
      to cleave and cling to all others, and leave <i>him</i> alone. She may be
      "too ill" to attend with her husband; but let "Mr. Nimblefoot"&mdash;sprightly
      of heel and addled of brain&mdash;come along, with an invitation to attend
      a ball, and in a trice she so far recovers her declining health as to make
      such an elaborate toilet that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Not Cleopatra on her galley's deck,

      Displays so much of leg, or more of neck."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it is, when with a disregard for neighborly comments which would do
      credit to a better cause, we see her in all her naked loveliness. No
      vulgar restraint upon her movements, no "greeneyed monster" to inquire
      into her absence or take note of her doings. None to say
    </p>

      But a more detailed account of this lady and of "how it all came about,"
      is it not written in the chronicles of the Courts having "original
      jurisdiction" in cases of divorce?

    <p>
      Who, then, after reviewing this ghastly procession of moral lepers, shall
      find words wherewith to express his reverence and admiration for those
      pure-minded girls and women who refuse to dance&mdash;<i>on principle!</i>
      No renowned hero of ancient or modern times has a better right to claim
      the bays than the woman who, seeing the degradation of the modern dance,
      has the independence and moral courage to avoid it. Her heroism is greater
      than you might suppose, for she is sorely tempted to do wrong on the one
      hand, and severely punished for doing right on the other. Tempted&mdash;because
      she is as fair and graceful as her less modest sisters, and naturally as
      fond of man's admiration, and as sensible of physical pleasure as they;
      punished&mdash;by the sneers of women who call her "prude" and
      "wall-flower," and by the slights put upon her by men who avoid her
      because she "doesn't dance." In spite of the example set by those whom she
      has perhaps been taught to regard as wiser and better than herself, she
      yet resists the fascination of the Social Basilisk from pure pride of
      womanhood, and sacrifices her inclinations upon the altar of modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the wives and daughters who do honor to their families. Their
      reward is the respect and admiration of all honorable men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My child," said a friend of mine to his daughter who had declined to
      attend a "sociable" on the ground that dancing was improper, "my child, I
      honor your judgment, and let me give you a father's advice: never allow a
      man's arm to encircle your waist till you are married, <i>and then only
      your husband's</i>." And this advice I re-echo to all young ladies.

      here are, of course, many other classes of waltzers to whom I might
      revert, though I have sought in vain for a single one that is entirely
      free from reproach. It is however time that the evil should be viewed from
      other points. Let us consider some of its results and effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have repeatedly declared, and I now do so again that the waltz has grown
      to be a purely sexual enjoyment. That I may not be supposed to stand alone
      in this assertion I will again quote the words of the worthy clergyman
      before referred to. He writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      The dance "consists substantially of a system of means contrived with more
      than human ingenuity to excite the instincts of sex to action, however
      subtile and disguised at the moment, in its sequel the most bestial and
      degrading." And again: "it is a usage that regularly titillates and
      tantalises an animal appetite as insatiable as hunger, more cruel than
      revenge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gail Hamilton, to whose words most of us will attach some weight, I think,
      in a contribution to an Eastern journal, says: "The thing in its very
      nature is unclean and cannot be washed. The very <i>pose</i> of the
      parties suggests impurity." But I must go further than this, and assert
      that the and motions of the parties cannot even be <i>spoken</i> of by a
      young lady without danger of committing a <i>double entendre</i> at which
      many a "nice young man" will laugh in his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will illustrate this statement: A charming young lady, just arrived from
      abroad, informed me that we do not execute these new round dances "quite
      right" in this country. She describes it as having "two forward and two
      backward movements, then sideways, with a whirl." But she will "show me
      how to do it on the first opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That must, indeed, be nicer than the way we do it," said I, "though I
      have heard of a similar dance in the Sandwich Islands." Yea, verily, "to
      the pure all things are pure."
    </p>
    <p>
      What says St. Aldegonde in a letter written as long ago as 1577 to Caspar
      Verheiden? He says that he approves of the course adopted by the Church of
      Geneva, which by interdicting the dance has abolished many filthy abuses
      of daily occurance; it being the custom of the men to take young girls to
      balls at night and there to vex them by lewd posturing. No one, he
      contends, can look on at such a spectacle without sin; what then shall we
      say of those who take part in it. Much more he adds, and when I say that I
      dare not translate it here, the reader will be ready to believe that the
      worthy Saint is pretty plain-spoken in his strictures on the dance. But he
      is no more so than is Lambert Daneau in his "Traité des Danses," the
      perusal of which might do some modern dancers good. And yet both these old
      writers only saw the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out, for the Waltz
      did not exist in their day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this being the case, what are we to suppose are its effects upon
      those who indulge in it? Does the scandal end in the ball room, or, as
      Byron says, may we not marvel
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "If nothing follows all this palming work."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and do we not feel ourselves constrained to believe his assurance that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Something does follow at a fitter time."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That the waltz has been the acknowledged avenue to destruction for great
      multitudes, is a truth burnt into the hearts of thousands of downcast
      fathers and broken-hearted mothers; and the husbands are legion who can
      look upon hearths deserted and homes left desolate by wives and daughters
      who have been led captive by this magnificent burst of harmony and
      laying-on of hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of our ablest writers says: "it is a war on home, it is a war on
      physical health, it is a war on man's moral nature; this is the broad
      avenue through which thousands press into the brothel." The "dancing hall
      is the nursery of the divorce Court, the training ship of prostitution,
      the graduating school of infamy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Olaus Magnus tells us that the young people of the North danced among
      naked sword-blades and pointed weapons scattered upon the ground; <i>our</i>
      young people dance among far deadlier dangers than these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it, dear reader, picture to yourself the condition to which a
      young girl is reduced by the time that her carriage is announced. All the
      baser instincts of her nature are aroused&mdash;to use the words of
      Erasmus she has "a pound of passion to an ounce of reason." Answer me, is
      she not now in a fit state to fall an easy prey to the destroyer? And yet
      in this condition
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Hot from the hands promiscuously applied
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Round the slight waist or down the glowing side,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      she is almost borne to her carriage by an escort, "flown with insolence
      and wine" and whose condition is otherwise similar to her own, except that
      the excitement of the moment makes him as bold and ardent, as it renders
      her languid and compliant. He places her panting form upon the soft
      cushions, and with a whispered admonition to the coachman not to drive too
      fast, he ensconces himself by her side. But here, as upon an earlier page,
      we must leave them. The hour, the darkness, everything is propitious&mdash;it
      is little short of a miracle if she escapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Look out, look out and see
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      What object this may be

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us charitably suppose that the sequel is only a continuation of
      the license of the waltz, and that she reaches her home with merely the
      smell of the fire through which she has passed upon her garments&mdash;let
      us suppose that the <i>Ah si liceret!</i> of Caracalla has <i>not</i> been
      answered by the yielding <i>quic-quid libet licet</i> of his mother-in-law&mdash;and
      what is the result? The flame that has been aroused must be allayed. If
      she is unmarried, then in God's name let us inquire no farther; but if she
      is a wife then is the dear indulgent husband at home privileged to meet a
      want inspired in the embrace of "the first dancer in the valley," and to
      enjoy <i>some</i> advantage, at least, from the peculiar position which he
      sustains toward the matronly dancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now may we not take a peep at the fair <i>danseuse</i> as she comes
      into the breakfast-room at noon next day. Is this broken-down, used-up
      creature the radiant beauty of the night before? Can it be that that
      "healthful recreation," the Waltz, has painted those dark circles round
      her eyes and planted those wrinkles on her brow?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent15">
      "Alas, the mother, that her bare,

      In that wan cheek and wasted air

    <p class="indent20">
      She would not know her child."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She is paying now for the sweetness of "stolen waters" and the
      pleasantness of bread "eaten in secret." For the next week what pleasure
      will husband, father, or brother, derive from her society. She is ill and
      peevish&mdash;she is damaged both in body and soul. For the next week, did
      I say? Well, I meant until the next invitation to a dance arrives. That is
      the magic elixir that will brighten the dull eyes and recall the dead
      smiles to life. Then invoking the rejuvenating spirit of the cosmetic-box
      and tricked out in the finery which those most near, but not most dear, to
      her have toiled to purchase, she will sally forth to lavish upon the
      lechers of the ball-room a gracious sweetness which she never showed at
      home.

      But where is Apollo all this time?
    </p>
    <p>
      We left him burning with half satiated lust before the gate of his
      paramour's mansion. Where will <i>he</i> go to complete his debauch? At
      what strange fountains will <i>he</i> quench the flame that is devouring
      him? Go ask the harlot! <i>She</i> will reap the harvest that has ripened
      in the warm embrace of maids and mothers. She is equally fortunate with
      the husband described above. Ah, well! verily it <i>is</i> an ill wind
      that blows nobody good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Waltz is, therefore, in its effects, fearfully disastrous to both
      sexes, but nevertheless the woman is the greater sufferer&mdash;physically,
      because what is fatal excess for a woman may be only hurtful indulgence
      for a man, and morally, because she loses that without which her beauty
      and grace are but a curse&mdash;man's respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her punishment is just, her fault being more inexcusable than his. For
      woman is the natural and acknowledged custodian of morals. It is she who
      fixes the standard of modesty&mdash;a variable standard, it is true,
      different in different ages and countries, but always sufficiently
      well-defined. She draws across the path of passion, lines limiting, on the
      one hand, the license of masculine approach, on the other, the liberty of
      feminine concession. To a certain extent man may blamelessly accept
      whatever privileges she is pleased to accord him, without troubling
      himself to consider "too curiously" their consistency with the general
      tenor of her; decrees. It is her discretion in such matters that must, in
      a large, way, preserve the race from fatal excess. When, therefore, she
      shamelessly violates this sacred trust which nature and society have
      confided to her, it is to be expected that the ball-room <i>roué</i>
      should regard her as something lower than the harlot, who at least
      ministers to his lusts in a natural manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, what is worse still, she also loses moral caste with those who have
      more than a negative respect for honorable women. For even your <i>gentleman</i>
      is no professor of heroic virtues, and the same easy courtesy with which
      he dismisses the soliciting courtesan, restrains him from wounding, even
      by implication, the merely facile fair being whom favoring fortune has as
      yet prevented from taking to the street. He dissembles his disgust, begs
      the honor of her hand for the next dance, flutters her pulses to her
      soul's satisfaction, and regards her ever thereafter with tranquil,
      philosophical contempt. And so they come to mutually despise each other;
      she sets no value on his flattering praises, he no longer cares for her
      good opinion&mdash;the wine of woman's approval has gone stale, and the
      sunshine of man's admiration is darkened in her eyes.

      ut this "innocent amusement" entails worse consequences than these. It is
      the high-road to the divorce court, it has brought strife and misery into
      ten thousand happy homes; truly it is the "abomination that maketh
      desolation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the case of the poor, dull, stupid Benedick who, like Byron with his
      club foot, dances not at all. He is a splendid man of business, perhaps,
      and is highly respected on change; but here, in the ball-room, what is he?
      A dolt, a ninny, an old fogy, a nuisance&mdash;to be snubbed and slighted
      by the woman he calls wife for every brainless popingay who "dances
      divinely." He has been proud to toil from day to day to be able to
      purchase costly apparel with which to adorn this far better half of his;
      now he has the felicity of seeing the fine fruits of his labor dangled
      about the legs of another man; he had supposed her the "wife of <i>his</i>
      bosom," yet, behold! she reclines most lovingly on the bosom of another;
      she is the mother of his children, yet as she quivers in her partner's
      arms, her face is troubled with
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "The half-told wish and ill-dissembled flame."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He has pride enough to attempt to look interested, and to affect ignorance
      of his own shame, but the sham is apparent. Note how uneasily he sits upon
      the benches provided for such "wallflowers" as himself. Anyone who will
      take the trouble to observe him, can see that his heart is not in the
      waltz in which his spouse is taking such a lively interest. Approach him,
      now, and tell him that it is a very nice party, and that he seems to be
      enjoying himself. "Oh very nice," he answers with a ghastly grin intended
      for a smile, "I am enjoying it greatly." But now incidentally remark that
      after all you have no great liking for these "fancy dances," and see how
      quickly a fellow-feeling will make him wondrous confidential, as he
      answers:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To tell the truth, I don't like them at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you have known him when a bachelor and have seen him dance then.
      You mention this fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O yes," he answers, "of course I used to dance; but can't you see that
      there is a mighty deal of difference between hugging other people's wives
      and daughters to music, and taking your own wife to a place where every
      fellow can press her to his bosom and dangle his legs among her
      petticoats? No, sir, I do not like it, and if my wife thought as I do
      about it, there would be no more dancing in our family. 'I would rather be
      a toad and feed on the damp vapor of a dungeon, than keep a corner in the
      thing I love for others' uses.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Follow the conversation up and you will find that if ever Sorrow mocked a
      festival by its presence it is in the person of this man. He is not
      jealous, he is outraged; all the finer feelings of his nature are trampled
      under foot, he is grieved and deeply wounded beyond recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the beginning of the end; she is never the same woman to him
      hereafter; he may smile and appear careless, but none the less has that
      tiny satin slipper crushed all the fresh love from his heart. The second
      volume of his Book of Life is opened; the first chapter thereof being
      headed "Estrangement," and the last "Divorce."
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is not an exceptional case; the writer will venture the assertion
      that out of every fifty husbands who have dancing wives, there are at
      least a dozen who if spoken frankly to upon the subject would express
      themselves in terms of most bitter condemnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what kind of men are those who do <i>not</i> object to see their wives
      made common property in this manner? Well, there is your weak good-natured
      husband, who would willingly suffer any personal annoyance rather than
      thwart the wishes of his beloved wife, no matter how ill-advised those
      wishes may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer is personally acquainted with a young and newly-married man,
      whose experience will illustrate what I have just said, though it is true
      that eventually came to see the error of his ways. He had the misfortune
      to marry a lady who was excessively fond of dancing. He had never learned
      to waltz himself, but finding it impossible to remain a looker-on he
      determined to acquire a knowledge of the intoxicating art. He, poor fool,
      imagined that when he had conquered the first elements of the dance, his
      wife would take particular pleasure in attending to his further
      instruction. Picture, then, his surprise and disgust when on making his <i>début</i>
      in the ball-room he found that his wife would avail herself of every
      pretext to leave him to shift for himself&mdash;a conspicuous object for
      commiseration of the experts&mdash;while she accepted the amorous
      attentions of every clodhopper who possessed the divine accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were I, dear reader, to reproduce his exact words in giving expression to
      his indignation at and contempt for an institution the effect of which is
      to ignore the relations of husband and wife, and exalt the accomplishments
      of the heel over those of the head and heart, you would be shocked beyond
      measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his happiness was centred in this one woman; her good opinion was the
      dearest thing on earth to him. When therefore he found himself unable to
      partake <i>with her</i> of the pleasures of the dance, he tortured himself
      to acquire an art which in itself had no attraction for him, merely
      because he thought it would render him more pleasing in her sight. We have
      seen the manner in which she encouraged his first attempts; but the wrong
      was to be deeper yet. Content that her pleasure should not be spoiled by
      his bad dancing, he allowed her to choose her own partners, while he
      applied himself vigorously to his self-appointed task of learning to waltz
      "like an angel." Exactly how he achieved this end is not quite clear. He
      was not seen to practice much at the fashionable gatherings he attended
      with his wife; he was too sensitive to ridicule for that. Perhaps, like
      Socrates in his old age, he found some underground Aspasia who was willing
      to give him lessons in the art. But however this may be, certain it is
      that before long he had acquired a degree of proficiency which was quite
      surprising. Now, he triumphantly thought, his fond wife could have all the
      "Boston Dip" necessary for her "healthful exercise and recreation" without
      submitting her charms to the embrace of comparative strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, for his hopes! After walking through the stately opening quadrille
      with the "partner of his joys," he discovered that as though by magic her
      card had been filled by the young bloods who clustered about her; and then
      for the first time he was informed that after introducing his wife to the
      floor it was a breach of etiquette to monopolize her any further&mdash;he
      must either sit content to see her whirl, spitted on the same bodkin with
      men he had never seen before, or must turn his own skill to the best
      account and
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Give&mdash;like her&mdash;caresses to a score."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is more than likely that he adopted the latter course&mdash;most of his
      class do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those wives who are so eager, for various reasons of their own, that their
      husbands should learn to dance, might draw a wholesome lesson from the
      story of Caribert, king of Paris, whose wife Ingoberge would fain prevent
      him from spending so much time in the hunting-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end she prepared a series of splendid festivities, which she
      induced her lord to attend. Now, fairest and most graceful among the
      dancers were two sisters of surpassing beauty, named Méroflède and
      Marcovère. Having, at his queen's express solicitation, essayed the "light
      fantastic" with these ladies, the good Caribert, who had before no thought
      for any woman but his wife, suddenly became so enamored with the skill and
      grace of the sisters, that he not only forswore the chase forever, but
      with all possible despatch divorced Ingoberge and married first Méroflède
      and then Marcovère.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it is that this demon creeps between the husband and the wife,
      and sooner or later separates their hearts forever. The sturdy oak may
      laugh at the entering of the wedge, but his mighty trunk will nevertheless
      be riven asunder by it in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is one other type of ballroom husband, whose portrait must not
      be omitted. This is the miserable, simpering, smirking creature who fully
      appreciates the privilege of being permitted to furnish, in the person of
      his wife, a a well draped woman for other men's amusement; who has an idea
      that the lascivious embraces bestowed upon his wife are an indirect
      compliment to himself; who is only too happy to be a cooler to other men's
      lust in the ball-room, and is content to enjoy a kind of matrimonial
      aftermath in the nuptial chamber. Can any human being fall lower than
      this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Fenton has told us that flattery "supples the toughest fool," but I
      regard the man who thus willingly resigns his wife to the palming of these
      ball-room satyrs, merely because her beauty and gorgeous raiment bring
      notice upon him as the owner of so splendid an article&mdash;I regard this
      beast as a pander of the vilest kind; and a most foolish pander withal,
      for he simply purchases the title of cuckold at the price of his own
      dishonor and his wife's open shame. He loves to hear it said that she
      "dances divinely," though he knows that the horns on his forehead are
      plainer to none than to the fellow who tells him so. Bah! In the words of
      Mallet,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "He who can listen pleased to such applause
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Buys at a dearer rate than I dare purchase."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The budding horns affixed to the husband's pow in the fierce light of the
      ballroom have not the simple dignity of even the most towering antlers
      prepared by the "neat-handed Phyllis" of his heart in the domestic
      seclusion and subdued half-lights of a house of assignation. In the one
      case he poses as a suppliant for honors to mark his importunity; in the
      other his coronation is the unsought reward of modest merit. The Waltz may
      not <i>make</i> such despicable creatures as I have described above, but
      it at least affords them an opportunity to parade their own degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the modern Terpsichore has to answer for, if possible, still worse
      consequences than the seducing of our maids, the debauching of our young
      men, the prostitution of our wives, and the debasing of human nature, both
      male and female. She is worse than a procuress, there is <i>blood</i> upon
      her skirts, she is a murderess.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the day when Herodias danced John the Baptist's head into a trencher
      the dance has been the cause of violence and bloodshed. The hate and
      jealousy which smoulder within the breast of the rejected lover, and which
      he is struggling to extinguish, burst into flame at the sight of her he
      loves folded in ecstacy upon the breast of his rival. His cup was already
      full&mdash;this is <i>more</i> than he can bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may pass by Venetian masquerade and Spanish fandango&mdash;where the
      knife of the avenger sends the victim's, blood spurting into the face of
      his partner&mdash;and may look nearer home, at our fashionable "hops" and
      "sociables," where, though the Vendetta may not be carried out upon the
      floor (and instances of this are not lacking) it is nevertheless declared,
      and where, though no mute form be borne out from the ball-room to the
      grave, the dance is none the less a veritable Dance of Death&mdash;a dance
      of murdered love and slain friendship, of stabbed and bleeding hearts, of
      crushed hopes and blighted prospects, of ruined virtue and of betrayed
      trust.

      nd now if I have succeeded in showing the modern dance as it is and the
      dancers as they are, together with the almost inevitable effects of the
      evil upon those who indulge in it, my main object is accomplished. I did
      not set out to deal with theories, but with facts. Indeed, did those whose
      godly calling places them on the watch-towers of the church, use a tongue
      of fire to lay bare this pernicious practice, and obey the divine mandate:
      "Thou shalt teach my people the difference between the holy and profane,
      and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean," and did
      those whose office it is to speak to the millions through the myriad
      tongued press, use a pen of flame to expose this growing iniquity, then
      would this thankless task be spared me. But when
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Pulpits their sacred satire learn to spare,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And vice admired to find a flatterer there,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      then I say a layman must speak, or the stones would cry out against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no personal or pulpit popularity to preserve, would not preserve it
      if I had at the price of divesting this public sensuality of its terrors,
      or at the risk of not causing the types of dancers herein painted to
      shrink from their own portraits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only remains for me, then, to make a few concluding and general
      remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often urged that dancing cannot ' be desperately wicked, because it
      is "tolerated by all except those of narrow and bigotted religious views."
      A greater mistake was never made, I assert that there are hosts of men who
      never permit the members of their families to take part in round dances.
      Nor is this the result of religious bigotry. With most of them "religion,"
      in the popular sense of the word, does not enter into the question at all&mdash;they
      are not too <i>pious</i>, but too <i>chaste</i> to dance. In their eyes
      this familiar "laying on of hands" is essentially indecent, and they
      cannot see that the fact of its being done in public makes it any <i>less</i>
      indecent. They will not allow even omnipotent Fashion to blind them in
      this matter, especially when they see that the vice is most common among
      those who <i>lead</i> the fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far be it from me, however, to imply that even the most ardent votaries of
      the dance are blind to its impurity. No indeed. Is there one so-called
      respectable woman among them who would submit to be painted or
      photographed in the attitude she assumes while dancing the latest variety
      of waltz&mdash;even though her partner in the picture, instead of being a
      stranger just met for the first time, were her most intimate friend&mdash;aye,
      even though he were her husband? Not one of them would submit to be thus
      depicted; but if some maiden <i>could</i> be persuaded, what a pleasing
      family picture it would be for her husband and children to gaze upon in
      later years! Had I such an one to illustrate this book with, the success
      of its mission would be assured, with the simple drawback of the author
      being held amenable to an offended law for issuing obscene pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a representation would immediately effect the fulfillment of a
      prophecy made by the writer of a recent work entitled "Saratoga in
      Nineteen Hundred." In those times there is to be no more dancing. The
      gentlemen, it is true, are to engage the ladies for a portion of the
      evening as in these benighted days; but instead of taking her on the
      floor, he will retire with her to one of a number of little private rooms
      with which every respectable mansion is to be provided, and there they
      will do their hugging in private. A great improvement, certainly, upon the
      present plan, in such matters as decency and comfort, but scarcely in
      completeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will only remain for the sons and daughters of that future generation
      to make dancing their religion. Let them convert their churches into
      dancing-halls, and set up an appropriate image of their deity&mdash;the
      Waltz&mdash;upon the altars; not the decently draped Terpsichore of the
      dark, pagan past, but the reeling Bacchante&mdash;flushed, panting,
      dishevelled, half-naked, half-drunk, half-mad&mdash;of the enlightened;
      Christian present; let the grave priest give way to the gay
      master-of-ceremonies, and the solemn benediction to the parting toast; let
      the orchestra occupy the pulpit, and the "wallflowers" sit in the vestry;
      let the pews be swept away, and the floors duly waxed and polished, but
      let not the tablets of the dead be removed&mdash;they are the "handwriting
      upon the wall," the <i>mene, mene, tekel, upharsin</i>, most fitting for
      those to read who delight in the Dance of Death. Then, when the
      prayerbooks are programmes, and the hymnbooks the music of Strauss, the
      jingle of the piano may mock the dumb thunder of the organ, and the
      whirling congregation may immortalize a bard of to-day by singing the
      following verses of his composition to the "praise and glory of"&mdash;the
      Waltz:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "In lofty cathedrals the organ may thunder
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Its echoes repeated from fresco-crowned vaults,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the multitude kneeling in rapture may wonder,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But give me the music that sounds for the waltz!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The Angels of Heaven, in glory advancing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Are singing hosannahs of praise to the King;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Unless they have women, and music, and dancing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Forever unheeded by me they may sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh! take not the sunshine that knows no to-morrow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The rivers of honey and fountains of bliss,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Where the souls of the righteous may rest from their
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      sorrow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      They have not a joy that is equal to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When the dead from their graves stand in awe and des

      ponding,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And the trumpet calls loud on that terrible day,

    <p class="indent15">
      To our names on the roll there will be no responding&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But having brought this delectable "recreation" to the utmost pitch of
      refinement of which it is susceptible&mdash;a condition it bids fair
      promise to attain in a few more seasons, I feel that it is time, as Byron
      has it, to "put out the light." I therefore conclude with a very brief
      exhortation to my readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To dancers one and all I would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      Try and see yourselves as others see you; remember that there are many
      harmless pleasures that have about them no taint of filthy lust; above all
      cease to believe or to assert that the modern waltz is an "innocent
      amusement."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the women, in particular, I say: Set your faces against this
      abomination, which is robbing you of man's respect, and is the primal
      cause of infinite misery to yourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the men I would say: Those who are the natural arbiters of what is
      permissible between man and woman, have shown their weakness and betrayed
      their trust; it is now for you to show your strength and redeem your
      honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      You who are unfavorable to the modern dance, I adjure not to let your
      opposition be merely negative, but to work positively for the putting down
      of the evil precisely as you might for the suppression of prostitution or
      any other corrupting influence. For as surely as thy soul liveth, this is
      "a way that seemeth good unto a man, but the end thereof is death."
